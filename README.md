# IJ-Colour_Deconvolution2
The Colour Deconvolution 2 ImageJ plugin implements stain unmixing with Ruifrok and Johnstonâ€™s method described in [Ruifrok AC, Johnston DA. Quantification of histochemical staining by color deconvolution. Analytical and Quantitative Cytology and Histology 23: 291-299, 2001]. The technique is useful to unmix dyes in images where colours mix subtractively (bright field microscopy using histological stains, watercolours or printed material using transparent inks). It is not suitable for fluorescence microscopy (fluorophores mix additively) or reflectance images. The code is based on a NIH Image macro kindly provided by A. C. Ruifrok with additional modifications. See the source code for the version history and contributors.
